Project 1

Notes:

- Program runs
  - To run program:
    - ant init
    - ant compile
    - java SearchMap inputfile.txt outputfile.txt

- To clean
  - ant clean

- Other:
  - ant doc and ant dist work
  - ant test not included because confused on how to do Junit
  - Notes on Junit confusion:
    - Was unsure of what to test for my java files because SearchMap.java is just a main function and Flight.java is just a contructor
    - Tried to implement some junit testing in TestFlightMap.java. Not tested though
